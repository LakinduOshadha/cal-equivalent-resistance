# cal-equivalent-resistance

Electrical resistors are said to be connected “in series” if the same current passes 
through each and “in parallel” if the same voltage is applied across each. If in series, 
they are equivalent to a single resistor whose resistance is given by 
R=R1+R2+R3+ - - - - - - - +Rn 
If in parallel, their equivalent resistance is given by 
1/R = (1/R1+1/R2+1/R3+ - - - - - - - +1/Rn) 

equivalent-resistance.m prompts the user for the type of connection (series or 
parallel) and computes the equivalent resistance.
